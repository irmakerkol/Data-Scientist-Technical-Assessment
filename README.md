# Data Scientist Technical Assessment Report
## Introduction
This report presents the findings and methodology used in the Papcorns Data Scientist Technical Assessment. The analysis was conducted using SQL and Python to extract insights from a SQLite database containing user and event data. The objective was to evaluate key business metrics including revenue, user acquisition, conversion, and customer lifetime value.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of two tables: 'users' and 'user_events'. The 'users' table includes user information such as ID, country, attribution source, and account creation timestamp. The 'user_events' table records events performed by each user such as trials, subscriptions, and cancellations, along with any associated revenue.

## Analysis Summary

### Total Revenue by Country
The highest total revenue was generated by users from the United States (US), followed by the Netherlands (NL) and Turkey (TR). Revenue was calculated from 'subscription_started' and 'subscription_renewed' events.

### Trials from Instagram Users
A total of 210 users who were acquired via Instagram initiated a trial period.

### Acquisition Channel Classification
Users were classified into two acquisition channels: 'Paid' for Instagram and TikTok, and 'Organic' for users from organic sources. Approximately 65.7% of users came through paid channels.

### Conversion Rate Analysis
The overall trial-to-subscription conversion rate was approximately 70.5%. Organic users showed a slightly higher conversion rate at 71.6%, compared to Instagram (70.95%) and TikTok (69.07%).

### Median Subscription Duration by Country
Median subscription duration (in months) was longest in Turkey (2.83), followed by the Netherlands (2.73) and the United States (2.53).

### Average Lifetime Value (LTV) by Country
The US had the highest average Lifetime Value (LTV) at $25.07, with the Netherlands at $22.38 and Turkey at $13.31.

### Conclusion
The analysis highlights key patterns in user behavior and revenue performance. Users from paid acquisition channels convert at a high rate, but organic users slightly outperform in conversion. While Turkish users retain subscriptions for longer, they contribute less revenue compared to US users. These insights can guide marketing strategies and pricing models.
